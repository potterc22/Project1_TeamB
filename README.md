Football
To bet on football, tell the ticket writer the bet number of the team you wish to bet, with the point spread and the amount you wish to wager. The payout, unless stated otherwise, is figured at odds of 10/11. This means that a wager of $11 would win $10 and return $21.
This is called a straight bet. A straight bet is the most common type of football bet.
The point spread: When betting on football, the team you bet on must "cover the spread." This means the team must win or not lose by a predetermined margin of points.
Example:
Bet No.	Team	Line
101	Jets	 
102	Dolphins	-6
Note: The bottom team is always listed as the home team unless otherwise noted.
The point spread is always placed to the immediate right of the team that is favored. If you bet the Dolphins, the Dolphins must win by 7 points for you to win your bet. If you bet the Jets, any of the following will declare you a winner.
(a) The Jets win the game.
(b) The game ends in a tie.
(c) The Jets lose the game by not more than 6 points.
If the Dolphins win by exactly 6 points, the wager is declared a push and all money is refunded.
Point spreads change constantly. The listed point spread at the time you make your bet may be different from the point spread when the game starts. The point spread that is listed on your ticket is your official spread.
Bet No.	Team	Line	Total	Money Line
101	Jets	 	40	+160
102	Dolphins	-6	 	-180
Total: Total points scored in a game. Also called the over/under.
You may wager that the total score of the game will be more or less than the number listed. It makes no difference which team covers the spread. Simply add the final score of each team. The payout, unless stated otherwise, is figured at odds of 10/11.
In some cases, bettors have the option to discard the point spread and bet on which team will win. This is called betting on the "Money Line"
The Money Line: Odds for a game based on $1.00. A "minus" (-) preceding the number indicates the team is a favorite. A "plus" (+) preceding the number indicates the team is an underdog.
Bet No.	Team	Line	Total	Money Line
101	Jets	 	40	+160
102	Dolphins	-6	 	-180
The Dolphins' odds are -180, meaning an $18 bet would win $10 for a return of $28. The Jets' odds are +160, meaning a $10 bet would win $16 for a return of $26.
