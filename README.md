# Project1_TeamB

Our team was interested in what factors affect the outcome of NFL games and the prediction of scores for betting statistics. 

We found 3 CSV files on Kaggle for NFL Stadium Details, NFL Team Details, and NFL Score Data for 1966-2019.

We decided to focus on the 2002 â€“ 2018 seasons, due to seasons outside of that range missing most weather data and it was the last time divisions were changed around. We removed Playoff data to keep the number of games per team consistent (NFL Regular Season), and playoff games were also missing weather data.


# Questions:

Does Weather Have an Effect on the Total Points of an NFL Game?

Does the timing of the game impact total score?

Is there truly a home field advantage?
